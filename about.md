# Who
I'm João (but you can call me John, Juan, ジョン... It means the same thing), I am a Computer Scientist, programmer, linux enthusiast and a Cybersecurity researcher wannabe

In this blog I will write posts mainly focused on technology and the side-projects I come up with. But I reserve the right to write about whatever else I find worthwhile sharing.

# Why

Above all else I want to learn more about the topics that interest me, with a main focus on cybersecurity and programming. This blog exists so that I can condense, write down the knowledge acquired from my projects, share it with whoever is willing to read it, and hopefully contribute positvely to others' learning experience.

# Where
`Here, on the wire...`
